# Bloxd-Code-Editor
A high-performance code editor that replicates the in-game editor of [Bloxd.io](https://bloxd.io) within your browser.  
Built using [JavaScript modules (esm.sh)](https://esm.sh), it provides a development experience close to professional environments.

- Main Control Buttons

## Syntax Highlighting
This feature categorizes code elements by color to improve readability.  
It utilizes CodeMirror via [esm.sh](https://esm.sh).  
The following color scheme applies when the [Language](#Language-Selection) is set to JavaScript:

| Category | Color | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Variables & Properties | `#e06c75` | `const name`, `player.pos` |
| Strings | `#98c379` | `"Hello World"` |
| Keywords (async, etc.) | `#e5c07b` | `async`, `await` |
| Operators | `#56b6c2` | `+`, `-`, `=`, `=>` |
| Punctuation & Brackets | `#abb2bf` | `()`, `{}`, `;`, `,` |
| Control Flow & Declarations | `#c678dd` | `if`, `else`, `function`, `let` |
| Function Names | `#61afef` | `print()`, `addEvent()` |

*Note: If you encounter any highlighting issues, please report them in the Issues section.*

Additionally, when the cursor is placed on a bracket, both the active and its matching bracket are highlighted. This makes it easier to navigate complex code structures.

## Auto-completion
When you type an opening bracket, the corresponding closing bracket is automatically inserted. This also applies to HTML tags.  
Furthermore, when the language is set to JavaScript, a suggestion list appears as you type keywords.  
This includes the Bloxd API; typing part of an API function name will display a list of matching functions along with their descriptions. (Callbacks are only displayed in World Code mode. See [World Code / Code Block](#World-Code-/-Code-Block) for details.)

## Tooltip Features
The tooltip menu primarily handles text searching.  
You can open it by pressing `Ctrl + F` while the cursor is in the editor, or by clicking the [Show Tooltips](#Hide-Tooltips-/-Show-Tooltips) button.

### Search
Enter the text you want to find in the "Find" field to highlight matching results.  
- **next / previous**: Navigate through the results.  
- **all**: Selects and highlights all matches.  
- **match case**: Distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase letters.  
- **regexp**: Enables Regular Expressions. For example, `^ab` finds text starting with "ab".  
- **by word**: Searches for whole words only. Searching "ab" will match `ab-ab` or `ab ab`, but not `abab`.

### Replace
Use this to swap text. Enter the original text in the Search field and the new text in the "Replace" field.  
- **replace**: Replaces the currently selected match.  
- **replace all**: Replaces every occurrence in the code.

## Main Control Buttons
Located below the code input area, these buttons provide various utilities:

### Language Selection (Dropdown)
Changes the [Syntax Highlighting](#Syntax-Highlighting) mode. Selecting a different language updates the color scheme to match that language's syntax.

### Submit Code
Saves the current code to a file.  
In the actual Bloxd.io game, this would save the code to a block and close the UI. In this editor, it triggers a file download/save.

### Show Docs
Opens the official Bloxd Code API documentation.  
Redirects to the [Bloxdy/code-api](https://github.com/Bloxdy/code-api) GitHub repository.

### Format Code
Automatically formats your code using **Prettier** via [esm.sh](https://esm.sh).  
It tidies up the code according to the language rules and displays an error message if the syntax is invalid.

### Copy Code
Copies the entire code to your clipboard.  
While this performs the same action as `Ctrl+A` > `Ctrl+C`, it is included because the actual Bloxd.io game editor often fails to select the entire script (only selecting the visible area) when using keyboard shortcuts.

### Hide Tooltips / Show Tooltips
Toggles the visibility of the auto-completion list and the search/replace tooltips.  
When set to `Hide Tooltips`, suggestions will appear; when set to `Show Tooltips`, they are disabled.

### World Code / Code Block
Toggles between **World Code** and **Code Block** modes.  
The main difference is the availability of Callbacks. In this editor, this toggle only affects the auto-completion suggestions.  
*Note: In the actual game, Code Blocks trigger on click/interaction, while World Code runs as part of the world logic.* The current mode is displayed in the status bar at the bottom of the editor.
